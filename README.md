# Car_Brand_Predictor

From a dataset created by me, I want to train and get in practice knowledges about images databases, image manipulation and CNNs to develop a model that be capable to predict the brand of cars from a photo.

You will find two different projects, Car_Brands_EfficientNetV2S and Car_Brands_Yolo. Are two different ways to face this kind of task. 

Libraries used in this project:
* OpenCV
* PIL
* Numpy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow
* Yolov8
* Matplotlib

This project was generated with educational porpuses.
